## About ðŸ‘‹
This project is about a web-based game where users have 5 attempts to guess a song. With each attempt, an additional second of the song is played to help users make their guess.
The game challenges users to recognize songs and introduces them to new artists they may not have heard before.
This project is designed using a microservice architecture. Each microservice is placed in a separate repository, allowing team members to manage their respective services without conflicts during development.
Microservice architecture allows for scalable and flexible performance based on user demand. Each service can be independently scaled according to its usage, and services are decoupled, enabling changes to be made to one service without impacting others

- user-service
